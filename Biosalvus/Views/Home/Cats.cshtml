    Cats are cute animals in the minds of many people. They are not only good friends of human beings, but also symbols of quietness, elegance and harmony. However, what people do not know is that cats have a huge threat to endangered species.<br />
    Many small wild animals were killed when the cat wandered into the wilderness. In just one day, Australia 39 million of cats kill approximately 1.3 million birds, 1.8 million reptiles and over 3.1 million mammals. There are 2 million to 6 million wild cats in Australia alone, so how to monitor and control these wild cats and domestic cats becomes a problem that cannot be ignored when considering the protection of endangered species.<br />
    BioSalvus is an efficient and practical dashboard. It can not only provide a clear map of possible infestations about Australian cats, but also allow you to see the distribution of different species at different times through the filtering function. These data can be used to compare, learn and predict the possibility of cats and species appearing in an area at the same time.<br />
